Logs:    /usr/local/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_j9.log

#runs on port 9200 - 9300.

To have launchd start elasticsearch at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load elasticsearch now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:

#to run config for elastic search
  elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml

#see if elastic search is running
http://localhost:9200/

    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load redis now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
