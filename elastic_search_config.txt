Data:    /usr/local/var/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_j9/
Logs:    /usr/local/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_j9.log

#runs on port 9200 - 9300.

To have launchd start elasticsearch at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load elasticsearch now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:


    elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
