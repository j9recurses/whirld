Rich annotation plugin (drawing, text, and more) for Leaflet extending Leaflet.draw.  Designed to help people tell the story behind the maps that they create.

Created for [MapKnitter](mapknitter.org), a free and open-source tool for stitching (or orthorectifying, in geographer-speak) grassroots aerial imagery into a composite "satellite" map.  This Leaflet plugin is designed to address the needs of the MapKnitter community, in particular, but is useful in any applications where rich map annotation is desired.
